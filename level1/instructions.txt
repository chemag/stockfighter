=Instructions

Welcome to Your New Job

These instructions are always available under the Instructions tab if you need
to see them again.

Congrats on being employed at Carling Brothers. We're sure you'll love it here.
You have been granted control over account CB78914943 and have full authority
to conduct trades on it... subject to the not-so-watchful eye of our risk
management desk, naturally.

First order of business: This is a blotter interface. It connects your terminal
to ECAU Moscow Exchange (ECAMEX), a well-regarded stock exchange. We've
pre-loaded it to track your first assignment, the shares of SystemMeat Corp.
(SMC).

=Your Goal
Get acquainted with this interface.
Watch the market participants trade a bit.

When you're ready, purchase 100 shares. (Try using a market order. Not sure
about what that means? Read about Order Types in the instructions menu.)

=You'll Be Fired If

The risk management desk is at an offsite today. Parachuting into a volcano, apparently. No rules until Monday!
